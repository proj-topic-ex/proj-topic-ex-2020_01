Overview
Tools to obtain overviews of a scientific field for nonexperts by capturing research trends simply, and then to verify the method.

## Description
The system first displays a graph of the number of publications. Parameters can be set to display a ranking of the frequency of the bigrams. The parameters are “Period of new word extraction (year),” “Period for defining the base words (year),” and “Unit period of extraction (year.”).” In the execution of a search after the parameters are set, a ranking table displayed the frequency of occurrence of bigrams. Each term in the table has a link to original article records so that the user could confirm abstracts and other bibliographic items. Furthermore, if the number of terms that had certain occurrences per unit period (year) surpassed a threshold, it could be graphically displayed. Use data downloaded from SciFinder.
